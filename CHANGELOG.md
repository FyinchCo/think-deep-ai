## [2.0.0] - 2024-01-07

### ðŸ”’ SECURITY UPDATE - CRITICAL
Major security overhaul implementing enterprise-grade authentication and data protection.

#### Added
- **Authentication System**: Complete Supabase Auth integration
  - Email/password authentication with JWT verification
  - Secure session management and auto-refresh
  - Protected routes with authentication guards
  - User profile management system

- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Complete data isolation
  - User-specific access policies for all tables
  - Authenticated-only access requirements
  - Secure foreign key relationships with user ownership

- **Edge Function Security**: API endpoint protection
  - JWT verification enabled for all sensitive functions
  - Authentication middleware for API calls
  - Rate limiting and abuse prevention

#### Changed
- **BREAKING**: All database operations now require authentication
- **BREAKING**: API endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **Database Schema**: Added user_id columns to core tables
- **Code Execution**: Replaced dangerous Function() constructor with safe pattern matching
- **Security Policies**: Migrated from public access to authenticated user policies

#### Security Fixes
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Eliminated dangerous dynamic code execution vulnerability
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Fixed completely public database access
- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**: Secured unprotected edge functions
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Fixed function search path security issue
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: Implemented input validation and sanitization

#### Migration Required
