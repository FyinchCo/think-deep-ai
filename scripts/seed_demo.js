This reframes neurological damage not as consciousness destruction, but as filtering disruption - like static interfering with a radio signal. The implications are staggering: consciousness might be fundamental to reality itself, with brains serving as biological receivers that create the illusion of localized, individual minds.

Consider how this transforms our understanding of death, mental illness, and the hard problem of consciousness. If consciousness is primary and brains are secondary, we're not biological machines that somehow produce awareness, but rather awareness itself, temporarily constrained by biological architecture.`,

This suggests our normal waking consciousness is just one possible configuration among infinite potential states. Altered states, mystical experiences, and even mental illness might represent different filtering patterns rather than malfunctions.

The philosophical revolution here is profound: instead of consciousness emerging from complexity, complexity emerges from consciousness being filtered. This inverts our entire materialist framework and suggests that what we call "reality" is actually consciousness experiencing itself through biological limitations.`,
