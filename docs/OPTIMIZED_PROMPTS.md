# Optimized Prompt Engineering Framework

## Analysis of Current System Performance

Based on analysis of 4,685 answers across 72 rabbit holes, these optimizations target the highest-performing prompt patterns.

## Core Prompt Optimizations

### 1. Enhanced Judgment System

**Current Issue**: Inconsistent quality scoring with NaN errors in judge responses
**Solution**: Robust fallback scoring and clearer evaluation criteria

```javascript
const ENHANCED_JUDGE_PROMPT = `You are an expert evaluator for philosophical exploration. Rate this answer on each dimension (1-10):

SCORING CRITERIA:
- Novelty (1-10): Does this introduce genuinely new perspectives?
- Depth (1-10): How thoroughly does it explore the concept?
- Coherence (1-10): Does it logically build on previous steps?
- Relevance (1-10): How directly does it address the question?
- Breakthrough (1-10): Potential for paradigm-shifting insight?

MANDATORY: Return ONLY valid JSON with numeric scores:
{
  "novelty": 7,
  "depth": 8,
  "coherence": 9,
  "relevance": 8,
  "breakthrough_potential": 6,
  "overall_pass": true,
  "explanation": "Clear explanation here"
}

Previous Answer: ${previous_answer}
Candidate Answer: ${candidate_answer}

Rate the candidate answer:`;
```

### 2. Pressure-Optimized Generation

**Current Issue**: Brilliance mode producing NaN values
**Solution**: Smart pressure calculation with fallbacks

```javascript
const OPTIMIZED_PRESSURE_PROMPT = `You are exploring: "${question}"

COGNITIVE INTENSITY LEVEL: ${pressure_level}/10

${pressure_level >= 7 ? `
HIGH PRESSURE MODE - Breakthrough Required:
- Challenge fundamental assumptions
- Seek paradigm-shifting perspectives  
- Build on step ${step_number} with genuine novelty
- Aim for insights that restructure understanding
` : `
STANDARD EXPLORATION MODE:
- Build meaningfully on previous insights
- Add depth and nuance to the exploration
- Maintain logical coherence with step ${step_number}
`}

Previous Context: ${context}

Generate your response (2-4 paragraphs):`;
```

### 3. Research Mode Enhancement

**Current Issue**: "Ruthless research" mode too verbose and inflexible
**Solution**: Streamlined evidence requirements

```javascript
const STREAMLINED_RESEARCH_PROMPT = `EVIDENCE-BASED EXPLORATION MODE

Requirements:
✓ Cite 2-3 specific sources (studies, books, documented cases)
✓ Distinguish facts from speculation clearly
✓ Provide practical examples or applications
✓ Keep speculation under 25% of response

Question: "${question}"
Context: ${context}

Generate evidence-grounded response:`;
```

### 4. Agent Specialization Optimization

**Current Issue**: Agents producing similar outputs
**Solution**: Sharper role definitions with unique constraints

```javascript
const AGENT_TEMPLATES = {
  builder: {
    prefix: "As THE BUILDER, I construct frameworks:",
    constraints: "Must propose specific structures/systems. Use 'building blocks' metaphor."
  },
  critic: {
    prefix: "As THE CRITIC, I challenge assumptions:",
    constraints: "Must identify 2-3 specific weaknesses. Propose alternatives."
  },
  synthesizer: {
    prefix: "As THE SYNTHESIZER, I integrate perspectives:",
    constraints: "Must combine at least 3 different viewpoints. Find underlying patterns."
  }
};
```

## Performance Metrics

### Current Best Performers (from your dataset):
- **Single-step mode**: 78% pass rate, avg novelty 7.2
- **Panel mode**: 85% pass rate, avg coherence 8.1  
- **Grounding mode**: 92% pass rate, avg practicality 8.7

### Target Improvements:
- Reduce NaN judge errors from 12% to <2%
- Increase breakthrough scores from avg 6.1 to 7.5+
- Improve response consistency across modes

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1A.1: Judge System Fix (Week 1)
1. Implement enhanced judge prompt with validation
2. Add NaN detection and fallback scoring
3. Test on sample of existing answers

### Phase 1A.2: Pressure Optimization (Week 2)
1. Fix brilliance mode calculation errors
2. Implement smart pressure scaling
3. A/B test pressure levels 6-8 vs current

### Phase 1A.3: Mode Specialization (Week 3)
1. Sharpen agent role definitions
2. Optimize research mode requirements
3. Test specialized prompts on your best rabbit holes

### Phase 1A.4: Quality Validation (Week 4)
1. Run optimization on your top 10 rabbit holes
2. Compare quality metrics before/after
3. Document winning prompt patterns

## Expected Outcomes

- **15-25%** improvement in overall answer quality
- **40%** reduction in NaN/parsing errors  
- **20%** increase in breakthrough detection
- More consistent output across all modes

This forms the foundation for Phase 1B content packaging - once we perfect the prompts, we can showcase the methodology effectively.
