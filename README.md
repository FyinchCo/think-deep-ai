*Main cognitive lab interface showing exploration controls and real-time quality metrics*

1. **Question Analysis**: Architectural analysis identifies breakthrough potential
2. **AI Generation**: Multiple models generate insights with cognitive pressure
3. **Quality Assessment**: AI judge scores responses on novelty, coherence, and depth
4. **Novelty Check**: Vector similarity prevents repetitive insights
5. **Breakthrough Detection**: Identifies paradigm-shifting concepts
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Each step builds on previous insights

## üéØ Exploration Modes

### Single Mode
Traditional AI interaction with quality scoring and novelty detection.

### Exploration Mode  
Three AI agents (Builder, Critic, Synthesizer) engage in philosophical discourse to reach deeper insights.

### Grounding Mode
Similar to exploration but with factual constraints and reality-checking to prevent pure speculation.

### Devil's Advocate Mode
Systematic contrarian analysis that challenges assumptions and explores alternative perspectives.

## üîß Customization

### Exploration Rules
Create custom rules that guide AI behavior:
- **Methodological**: How to approach problems
- **Constraint**: What to avoid or emphasize  
- **Stylistic**: Tone and presentation preferences
- **Domain-specific**: Subject matter guidelines

### Breakthrough Parameters
Adjust cognitive pressure and quality thresholds:
- Minimum breakthrough scores
- Pressure escalation rates
- Novelty similarity thresholds
- Research enforcement levels

## üöÄ Deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Cost Considerations
This system makes extensive use of AI APIs. Monitor your usage:
- Each exploration step can cost $0.01-0.10 in API calls
- Set up billing alerts in your AI provider dashboards
- Consider rate limiting for production use

### AI Model Availability
The system gracefully falls back between AI providers, but ensure you have valid API keys for at least OpenAI as the minimum viable configuration.

### Data Privacy
All user data is isolated and secure. However, insights generated are sent to AI providers for processing. Review each provider's data handling policies.
